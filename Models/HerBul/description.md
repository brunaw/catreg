## Description

The function
$$
f(x) = \theta_{0} + \theta_{1}(x^{\theta_{2}}), x > 0
$$

is known by [Herschel-Bulkley model](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjft/v16n4/a05v16n4.pdf) and
was proposed by Winslow Herschel and Ronald Bulkley in 1926.

This function is positive, increasing monotonic and can be concave or convex. It has three parameters:

  * $\theta_{0} > 0$, is the intercept;  
  * $\theta_{1} \geq 0$;
  * $\theta_{2} > 0$, define the type of curve. For:

    * $0 < \theta_2 < 1$, concave;  
    * $\theta_2 > 1$, convex;  
    * $\theta_2 = 1$, linear.
