## Description

The function
$$
  f(x) = (\theta_0 + \theta_1x)^{\frac{-1}{\theta_2}}, x \geq 0
$$

is known by [Bleasdale-Nelder model]().

For $\theta_2 > 1$, this function is positive, increasing monotonic and concave. It has three parameters

  * $\theta_{0} > 0$
  * $\theta_{1} \geq 0$
  * $\theta_{2} > 0 $
